# Broken App Issues
-	The script was not parsing the incoming JSON request body.
-	All API requests were being made sequentially which slows down the process.
-	The error handling was incorrect. Errors should be passed to next().
-	The err was not defined in the catch block.
-	No error handling middleware was implemented.
-	Hardcoded API URLs aren't best practice. They could potentially change and should be stored in a configuration.
-	Lack of comments in the code making it harder to understand.
-	No checking whether the incoming data is in the expected format or not. The code assumes the "developers" property will always exist and it will be an array.
-	The server port (3000) is hardcoded, it's a better practice to have it in an environment variable so it can be changed based on the environment where the app runs.
-	Use of var to declare variables, it's better to use const or let.
